<h1>The Best Movies According to Eugene</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />
<h3>The Fountain (2006)</h3>

<p>This is my favourite movie, hands down. If you like art movies, this one would hit the spot.</p>

<h3>Robocop (1987)</h3>

<p>I've grown up on this movie. I could watch this another 100 times.</p>


<h3>Mononoke Hime (1999)</h3>

<p>The best anime I have ever seen. It is about the good and evil of humans, and their connection with spirits/nature.</p>
